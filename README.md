Oral cancer poses a significant global public health challenge, with a substantial number of new cases being diagnosed annually. Accurate and consistent interpretation of histopathological tissue specimens, the gold standard for diagnosis, can be a formidable task. To address this, we present ORCHID, the ORal Cancer Histology Image Database, designed to facilitate research in medical image analysis. This comprehensive database encompasses over 300,000 image patches representing various categories, including oral submucous fibrosis and oral squamous cell carcinoma, with grade-wise annotation. This study focuses on a multicenter histopathological image dataset comprising oral cancer cases collected from different centers in India. Each specimen underwent independent review by at least two expert pathologists, who arrived at consensus diagnoses. The dataset encompasses a wide range of histological subtypes and grades of oral cancer, as well as pre-malignant and normal oral tissue for comparative purposes. Its establishment aims to provide a standardized and reliable reference for diagnosis and grading, while also facilitating the development and validation of novel diagnostic approaches. By making this extensive dataset available to the scientific community, we anticipate significant advancements in medical image analysis and improved accuracy in the diagnosis and grading of oral cancer. The ORCHID database serves as a valuable resource for researchers, enabling the exploration of innovative techniques and the refinement of existing methodologies in the field of oral cancer diagnostics.
